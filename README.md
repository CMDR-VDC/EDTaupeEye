# EDTaupeEye
Elite Dangerous Tool (using Tobii Eye trackers to play with Elite  Dangerous) From Galactic 911

**Abstract**

EDTaupeEye is an interface that allows you to use the Tobii Eye Trackers to play Elite Dangerous. 
The overlay splits the screen into multiple areas that can be activated individually using gazing 
and blinking to simulate a mouse click.

EdTaupeEye reads the Cutom.3.binds file in order to know the keyboard shortcuts. He can add his 
own shortcuts to access all the functions available in Elite Dangerous. The tool keeps a history 
of changes it has made to the file.

EdTaupeEye also scans the Status.json file to contextually adapt the functions that can be displayed.
